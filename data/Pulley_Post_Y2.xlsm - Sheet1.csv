Pulley9-10-19,1,Increase,I think it would increase because a single movable pulley has more Applied Force because it has only one pulley.  ,0,1,Increase,Because it has only one pulley it takes more energy to pull something that is heavy.,0,3,Both pulleys will require the same applied force,"Because it can be very hard to move if it is rusty,but it could be very slippery if it is oiled.",0,1,Increase,Because if you are trying to lift a watermelon it would take so energy(A.F.)to lift something very heavy I dont really think it is the pulleys that affect it.,0,1,Increase,I think that if there is more Applied Force there is more work that is needed,0,1,Jane is doing more work,"Well, I think Jane is doing the most work because she has to pull the object with her own strenghth and use her back and everything when Mary is using a pulley to lift it ...yes she still use her strenghth but not as much.",0,2,A rusty pulley that needs to be oiled,Because it would take a tough time to yank the rope if it gets stuck in the rust.,1,3,The amount of work done was the same,Because nothing changed all he did is pull it one more meter.,0,1,One fixed pulley,Because it has the same A.f. as all the others.,0,3,Pulley set-up A and Pulley set-up B will give you the same mechanical advantage ,Because it dosen't matter how much pulleys you have it all comes out the same.,1
Pulley9-10-189,1,Increase,"Since a fixed pully is not able to move, it is easier to move.

Pulley9-10-187,1,Increase,It would increase because a single pulley has a limited amount of string and for a single movable pulley the pulley goes up the string so that the string increases its length.,0,2,Decrease,It would decrease because when the string gets longer the less applied force there would be if there was less string or if you just pulled it.,1,1,A well-oiled pulley,a well oiled pulley has less applied force because if the pulley is not working weel and is rusty it will bes harder to pull up as if the pulley was well oiled and moving like it should it will be easier to pull up.,1,2,Decrease,It would decrease because it gives you more string so that the applied force will go down and it makes it easier to lift it up. ,1,1,Increase,increase because there is less work when you just lift it straight up so the work done would incease more.,0,2,Mary is doing more work,Mary is doing more work because lifting something straight up is less work than using a machine so mary is more work.,0,2,A rusty pulley that needs to be oiled,A rusty pulley will need more work because ifit is not runnig like it should you will have a harder time lifting it and that has more work.,1,2,When lifting the box 2 meters,2 because he lifted it higher so he did more work since it went higher than the other.,1,3,One movable pulley,1 movable pulley because the formula for machanical advantage is distance string pulled/distance load move. so the more lenghth of the string the more machanical advantage there is.,0,1,Pulley set-up A,A because there is more length there is so there will be more machanical advantage.,0
